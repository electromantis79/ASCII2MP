Change the project name in conf.py


This will auto build the docs but copy over the old ones.

	sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../

[SHIFT] + Right Click (Then click open command here)
	This if in the folder with MakeFile

make html

Next commit the change to GitHub and wait a couple minutes for RTD to update

All changes in .py files docstrings will be on RTD because it runs its own make html
.gitignore blocks the build folder from showing these changes

So to find an error if the docs badge fails the local make html must be run to have a local build that matches the one that failed
